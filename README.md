# 🧮 Basic Python Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on user input.

This project was created as part of an introductory Python programming assignment to practice:
- Variables
- User input/output
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional statements
- Basic error handling

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
2. The user selects a mathematical operation: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`.
3. The program performs the operation and displays the result.
4. If division by zero is attempted, an error message is shown.

## 🧑‍💻 Sample Output

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

## 📂 How to Run

### ✅ Option 1: Using Python IDLE
- Open `Calculator.py` in IDLE
- Press `F5` to run the code

### ✅ Option 2: Using VS Code
- Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
- Make sure Python is installed
- Open `Calculator.py`
- Right-click anywhere in the file and select **"Run Python File in Terminal"**

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Add more operations (modulo, exponentiation, square root)
- Create a loop to allow multiple calculations without restarting
- Build a GUI using Tkinter
- Add unit tests for each operation

## 📚 License
This project is open-source and free to use for learning purposes.
